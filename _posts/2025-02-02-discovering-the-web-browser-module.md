# Discovering the web-browser module

I like that after 14 years of using Python I can still find something new in it.

Today I used the `webbrowser` module for the first time. It allows you to open URLs in the browser installed on the system. It's not new, but I've never had a reason to use it before.

It can be used from the command line or from a script, and is very customisable. You can choose the type of web browser, whether to open the page in a new window or tab, and whether to run in the foreground or background.
