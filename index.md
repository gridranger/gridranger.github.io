# Welcome to my page

I created this page to learn Jekyll and post some of my notes. I'll be happy if you find them useful. 😊

I have a long history with Python and Robot Framework, so I will probably post a lot about those topics. I don't have much time to tinker, but I like to take notes so I can remember what I've learned. 🐍🤖

I like to use TDD and follow clean code principles, not only because I usually design code for long-term use, but also because I enjoy creating neatly organised code. 👓
